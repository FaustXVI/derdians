Information for Program Team:

Disdain is the failure mode of understanding across cultural boundaries.
Participants will experience that failure, as we separate them in two groupes that will obey two different modes of communication and make the groups communicate with each other.
We'll then show that there was no reason for the disdain they experienced.
Prerequisite Knowledge:

Basic english for half the participants

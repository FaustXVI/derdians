# Derdians

You live in a valley. The nearest village is 3 hours walk away but if you had a bridge, it would be reduced to only 1 hour.
Derdians are smart and welcoming people. They love stangers and ask a foreign nation to teach them about the art of making bridge.
Derdians are very proud and master a lot of things, making bridge is one of the rare things they dont master yet.

Derdians have some social rules :

* You need to be introduce by a female to a male before talking to a male, otherwise you fell insulted
* the derdian salute consiste of bumping your right shoulder to the other person's right soulder. Any other form of salute (like shaking hands) is an insult.
* To talk to someone, you need to have physical contact with her/him, otherwise you fell insulted. To join a group you only need to have contact to one of them.
* Saying "no" to someone is very insulting ! To express a no, derdians say yes and shake there head from right to left
* Since derdians values fraternity, if a derdian is insulted, they all fell insulted
* When a derdian is insulted, he/she screams
* Derdians are specialist. They chose one art and craft it exclusively so derdians are specilized in the manipulation of one tool (rule,pen,paper,...)

Of course, social rules are so natural, a derdians can't explain it ! It totally natural for them, that's the way things are !
This rule is VERY important, please don't mess with it !

The state of derdia signed a agreement with your company : you will have to teach derdians on hom to make a bridge.
You will have 20 minutes to design a prototype of the bridge you want to teach them and think of how you will teach them
Then, one of you will meet the derdians for 5 minutes to ask whatever question you need.
You will then have 10 more minutes to debrief and adapt before teaching.
Since, making a bridge is easy, you will have 10 minutes to teach them.

A proper teaching imply that you show all folding / cutting path by marking it with a pen.
The derdians wants to do everything, so you won't be allowed to touch any tool when teaching.
The bridge will have to at least 80 cm.
The bridge have to resist to the weight of the tools used to build it

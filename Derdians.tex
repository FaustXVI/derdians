\section{Derdians}

\subsection{Situation}

You live in a land named Derdia.
The village you live in is separated from the nearest town (where you get supplies) by a deep valley.
Going there is two days long.
If you had a bridge, five hours would be enough.

Your government signed a contract with a foreign company so that you will learn how to construct a bridge.
You will be then the first engineer of Derdia.
Once the first bridge will be constructed, you plan to construct many others in order to make your life easier.

The bridge will be constructed using cardboards, pens, rulers and scissors.
You know the materials and the tools, but not the building techniques.

\subsection{Social rules}

Derdians are used to have contact with each other.
Their communication leans on contact.
Not touching someone while talking is very rude and insulting.
If it happens, the insulted one will scream very strongly.

To join a group, you just have to be in contact with one member.

Saluting is very important even though you are just passing by.

The Derdian's salute is a shoulder bump.
The two people have to make contact with their right shoulder.
Any other salute is an insult! Shaking hands, as an example, is one of the most hidious insult in that country.

Of course, if insulted by a strange salute, Derdians screams very strongly.

A Derdian male will never be in contact with another male unless they've been introduce by a female first, Derdian or not.

Derdians never use the world \emph{no} since this is a great insult. They always say \emph{yes}. In order to say \emph{no}, they shake their head while saying \emph{yes}.

Derdian's work is also based on contact.
Some tools are dedicated to male, others to female.
Ruler and scissors are exclusively used by females. Pens, cardboards and anything that sticks are dedicated to males.
Anyone can manipulate all tools but only the allowed sex can use it correctly.

Derdians are very welcoming. If a Derdian is insulted, all derdians feel insulted and so scream very strongly.
 
\subsection{Hospitality}
 
Derdians likes strangers.
They also are very proud of themself and their culture.
They know they can't build the bridge without help, but it doesn't mean that strangers have an higher culture or education.
Building bridges is just an art they haven't mastered yet.
They want strangers to adapt to their culture.
Still, since their behaviour is perfectly usual to them it's impossible for them to explain it to strangers (this is \emph{really} important)

\section{Engineers}

\subsection{Situation}

You are a international team working for a very big company.
Your company just signed a contract with Derdia's government stating that you'll teach Derdians how to build a bridge.
The contract have a very strict deadline. Your boss told you that if the project is not finished on time, you'll be fired.

Derdia is a country full of mountains, canyons and deep valleys but without any bridge.
Derdians need two days of walk to go to the nearest city.
With a bridge, they will only need five hours.

Since there are so many rivers and canyons in Derdia, you can't just build a bridge and leave.
You will have to \emph{teach} Derdians how to build it.

\subsection{Bridge construction}

The bridge will be made of cardboards and stand between two chairs or table distant of approximatly 80 cm.
It must be stable. Once finished, it should be able to support the weight of the tools used to build it.

Derdians must learn the whole process; coming with the structure ready and assemble it in Derdia is not an option.

Each piece of the bridge will have to be drawn with a ruler and a pen and finally cut with scissors.
